# MarchMadness-Scorekeeper
Created a webscaper to assist with scorekeeping for a March Madness fantasy basketball game amongst friends.

We drafted players from NCAA Tournaments teams, to compete to see whose team would score the most points over the entire tournament. I created a Google Sheet to keep track of each team, and wrote this script to update the Sheet with points scored.
The script would be run at the conclusion of each day's games, and would add each player's point total to an Excel sheet. It scraped data from the CBS Sports scoreboard/box score websites.
